It's important to note that size_t is an implementation-defined type, meaning its actual size 
(in terms of bits) may vary between different platforms and compilers, but it is always chosen
 to be able to represent the size of the largest possible object on the system.
In modern C programming, it's common to use size_t when working with sizes, indices, or any
 variable representing the size of an object in memory.
